Goal: Increase Profits by 10% this year
To address the problem that Natalie wants to address, we would have to look into which sub-categories are selling the most. We would be able to increase profits by selling more of the best-selling items or reducing the worst-selling items. Another solution that is possible is to promote more in certain regions or sectors. 



As we can see from Figure one, we see that Copiers are the first sub-category and make the most profit with the profit being $55617.8249. We can clearly see that Copiers were beating the second sub-category by a huge margin which is about $11,000. As a result, I would dive more into why Copiers are profiting way more compared to other Sub-Categories and which regions and the product names which are selling the most. I would also look into the discounts that we are giving in the selling of the copiers.






Firstly, I looked out the regions that were profiting the most. Referring to Figure 2, I found out that West, East, and Central were close to each other. I, then, chose the East and West region to explore more regarding which sectors they were selling more and which product name they were selling more compared to the rest.  The figures three and four show that the east region was making a profit of $8, 567.93 in the consumer sectors while the West region was making $12,158.87 in the consumer sector.






After figuring out that the West was profiting more in the consumer sector by selling copiers. I wanted to see which product they were selling the most in that region.  The product name "Canon image CLASS 2200 Advanced Copier" stood out. Referred in figure five, we see that the product makes a sale of around 14,000 units and the profit is about $6,719.98. Upon finding out that the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier sold more compared to the other copiers, I wanted to figure out whether it was the discount that is enabling them to have a high profit margin and how its discount compared to the other copiers. 







Surprisingly, I discovered the Canon 2200 Advanced Copier did not even offer a discount compared to the other copiers. It was also surprising to find out that the 2200 Advanced Copiers were more than double the sales of the second place product, which was the Personal Laser Copiers. My initial thought was that the data might be skewed to one year because it is possible that the 2200 Advanced Copiers were popular in one year. I found out the Canon 2200 Advanced Copiers were sold mostly in 2016 and 2017 and were not found in the years 2018 and 2019. Referring to the figure seven, I found out that it profited around $15,680 in 2017 and $9,520 in 2016. 



Recommendation
The data analytics of this table made me question whether the Canon 2200 Advanced copiers stopped producing or whether these regions stopped selling.  I would recommend Natalie to concentrate on bringing the Canon 2200 Advanced copiers back to the West region since it is the region where the copiers are popular. In addition, we would be able to give a discount of 6%-20% for the copier looking at the trend from 2016 and 2017. I recommend focusing on the marketing and advertising of the Canon 2200 Advance copiers in the West and possibly lowering the discount or taking out the Hewlett Packard 310 Copier since we are barely profiting from this copier.
